             *
             * Cause:

             * How get:
             * ~ Edit roll note -> remove text from item -> save.

             * 2. Write wrong number of list items (can see in note card indicator on main screen).

             * Cause:
             * ~ Empty list items was removed after calculation of done items.

             * How get:
             * ~ After done of first bug.

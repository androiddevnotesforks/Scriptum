        Note:
        \nEveryone has different phones, which makes it difficult to put together a single
        list of things to do. Someone may have some items in application settings, it all depends
        on the phone manufacturer (in such cases skip the step). You can also watch a video
        demonstration by click on the \"video\" icon.
        \n
        \nI apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, there is no other way to make
        notifications that will not disappear.
        \n
        \nThings to do:
        \n1. Open minimized apps screen (application manager) and lock Scriptum. Use long click on
        application preview and click on lock image. This prevent application cleaning by system.
        \n2. In application settings turn on \"Autostart\". This will allow show notifications
        after phone restart.
        \n3. In application settings open tab \"Battery saver\", and there select
        \"No restrictions\". This will prevent application close by system.
        \n4. In application settings open tab \"Notifications\", and there select category
        \"Eternal service\". Turn off notifications for it (it\'s only available for Android Oreo
        and above). This need for hide system notification of application.
        \n5. Restart your phone for apply all changes.
        \n
        \nHope it will help! If you have any questions please write to email:
